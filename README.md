# Automated-Testing for Competitive Programmers
This project includes a guide on how to effiently check our code against the expected output with an easy debugging trick. 
The project generally comes in handy where the sample test cases are too big to easily debug. Also, Don't forget the copy-pasting functionality of editors for multiline inputs using either ctrl + v or ctrl + shift  + v.
